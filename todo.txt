- apply needs to be a function defined in terms of the actual apply in the
  interpreter.
	This means apply shouldn't take an environment argument.
	This means lambda.getEvalEnvironment can't take an environment
	The only reason this environment is needed is for self referential
	lambdas. e.g. recursive lambdas.
	This could be fixed by moving define out of eval and writing a proper
	read-eval-print loop in the language. Define define using functions
	that manipulate environment objects. We can set up an environment for
	the user that doesn't have such objects or functions.
